# Static IP address

To avoid constant new IP setting, it is good practice to set static IP in combination with Network Location.

1. Create "Network Location" for static IP (call it "Static IP") - [instructions](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/549)
2. After that, follow [instructions for setting static IP](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/550), **but instead of "Manual" choose "Using DHCP with manual address"**.
3. After that, to be secure, open 127.0.0.1 and new static IP in browser. You should get same content.
